This project analyzes how mobile internet (2G/3G) expansion affects employment, occupation, and skill outcomes in Nigeria using DHS microdata merged with lightning and GSM coverage data. The workflow first processes DHS datasets to construct individual- and household-level variables, then processes lightning and 3G coverage layers to create standardized exposure measures at multiple buffer distances and years (2012–2018). These processed datasets are merged to form analysis-ready files. The Jupyter notebook then runs weighted regressions with clustered standard errors and local-government fixed effects to estimate both contemporaneous and long-run impacts on employment, occupation type, skill level, and husband outcomes. Results are automatically exported as Excel tables in the “Final Results” folder.
